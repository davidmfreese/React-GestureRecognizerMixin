# React-GestureRecognizerMixin
[React-GestureRecognizerMixin](http://github.com/davidmfreese/React-GestureRecognizerMixin) brings UIGestureRecognizer to React Components.  [PanGestureRecognizer](http://github.com/davidmfreese/React-GestureRecognizerMixin/blob/master/src/GestureRecognizer/Recognizers/PanGestureRecognizer.js),  [TapGestureRecognizer](http://github.com/davidmfreese/React-GestureRecognizerMixin/blob/master/src/GestureRecognizer/Recognizers/TapGestureRecognizer.js) and  [GestureRecognizerMixin](http://github.com/davidmfreese/React-GestureRecognizerMixin/blob/master/src/GestureRecognizer/GestureRecognizerMixin.js) have been implemented.
  
See the [examples](http://github.com/davidmfreese/React-GestureRecognizerMixin/tree/master/examples) folder and code to learn more for now.  More concrete documentation will come after this project has matured. 

#### Examples:
* [Multi-Gesture Recongization](http://rawgit.com/davidmfreese/React-GestureRecognizerMixin/master/examples/gestureRecognizer-PanAndTap/Example.html)
  * Pan Gesture - Drag the square at will
  * Tap Gesture (1 tap) - Tap the square once and no more and the rectangle will grow
  * Tap Gesture (4 taps) - Tap the square four times in succession and the rectangle will grow

**WARNING** - This project was created to support [React-CollectionView](https://github.com/davidmfreese/React-CollectionView) so there can/will be many breaking changes in the short term.
